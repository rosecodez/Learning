I have started the Odin Project on 14th of Oct. 2021 in order to learn the base and foundation of web developing by firstly practicing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

On 15th I have finished a base project for HTML in which i have:

-created different html files connected to a main index page that is home to the website;
-created headers,paragrahps,lists, added images;
-arranged the code for a better understanding;
