    <h1>Pho</h1>
        <head>Description</head>
            <p>Pho is a Vietnamese soup dish consisting of broth, rice noodles (banh pho), herbs, and meat (usually beef)(pho bo), sometimes chicken (pho ga). Pho is a popular food in Vietnam where it is served in households, street stalls and restaurants countrywide. Pho is considered Vietnam's national dish.
            </p>
            <p>Pho originated in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam, and was popularized throughout the world by refugees after the Vietnam War.</p>
            <p>Because pho's origins are poorly documented, there is disagreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the name. The Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs.</p>
